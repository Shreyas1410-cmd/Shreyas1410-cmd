# 👋 Hi, I'm Shreyas !

I'm a **First-Year Computer Science student** passionate about building things while learning! 🚀  
Currently exploring **C**, **C++**, and **Python**, and strengthening my basics in **Data Structures and Algorithms**.  
I believe in learning by **building projects** and experimenting with code!
